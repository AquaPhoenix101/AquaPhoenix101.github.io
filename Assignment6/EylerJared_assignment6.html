						<h1>Small Green Pieces Of Paper</h1>
					</header>

					<p>
						"Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly nintey-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
					</p>
					<p>
						"This planet has - or rather had - a problem, whichb was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."

						<h1>Yearly Enjoyment</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
						This book is famous for so many reasons, and for me the introduction paragraphs are a part of that fame. In two short paragraphs, Douglas not only sets the starting location as Earth (which is pretty important when you're talking about a whole galaxy); he also cuts to the heart of humanity in saying that "most of the people on it were unhappy pretty much of the time". During my first read-through of the book, this had utterly stunned me.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before reading Adams' novel, I knew little about it except that it was filled with dry comedy (my favorite!) - to see this in action in the opening paragraphs floored me! I couldn't put the book down nor did I want to. While I haven't read the rest of the series (or any other books by Adams), I make it a habit to re-read <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</em> yearly. It never fails to get a laugh out of me despite how many times I read of the ape descendants fighting over little green papers.
